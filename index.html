            <h2 class="subsection-title">Overview of My Role</h2>
            <p>In all projects, my role encompassed the entire system development life cycle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirements Gathering and Analysis:</strong> Defining project scope and user needs.</li>
                <li><strong>System Design:</strong> Focusing on scalability, security, and usability. This included designing systems, user interfaces, wireframes, database designs, and OOPS middle-layer C# design. I also utilized producer-consumer architecture and various design patterns (Abstract, Interfaces, Sealed Class, Singleton, Chain, Builder).</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Sometimes involving business logic in the middle-layer (C# or DotNet) and sometimes in stored procedures/back-end.</li>
                <li><strong>Common Features:</strong> Most projects included dashboards, auditing abilities, and telemetry. Performance was improved using caching or multi-threading.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Product Focus:</strong> Significant attention was paid to 508 compliance and meeting WCAG 2.0 AA standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Resident-facing authentication used salt-db logins, while admin-side authentication and authorization utilized SSO (Tivoli or in-house product).</li>
                <li><strong>Post-production Support:</strong> Provided ongoing support and implemented enhancements as requested.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>A custom web crawler was made to scan pages for missing aria labels, and security vulnerabilities. After picking up URL’s the urls were followed for security vulnerabilities. A limited attack was made on the url which determined if there was an issue. A custom report was generated for vulnerabilities to be followed later. This was done using Java and BFS. DFS was considered but settled on BFS. Multi-threading and high ram was needed to store the Url’s in the map.</p>
